## Documentation

Garasi UI has two major elements

### [Components](https://github.com/kaskus/kaskus-car-ui/tree/internship/src/components)

Components consist of React Components. 

- They only have only one single purpose, and handle that purpose perfectly.
- They stand alone and reusable in any project; means they should look-physically and behave the same in any project or browser

### [Styles](https://github.com/kaskus/kaskus-car-ui/tree/internship/src/styles)

Styles are structured Sass architecture.

- They should be extensible and scalable.
- Styles are grouped by their scope, functionality, and purpose.
